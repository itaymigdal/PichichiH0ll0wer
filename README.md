# About

*--== Process hollowing loader written in Nim for PEs only ==--*

I built PichichiH0ll0wer to learn and contribute, sure. but also because I'm quite tired of shellcodes everywhere. 
Loading PEs might be less evasive, I know, but it's still efficient and more convenient than fighting to turn your PE payload into a shellcode each time (which not always works smoothly).
Also, PichichiH0ll0wer has some features to protect your payload.
I may add some more injection techniques and features in the future.
Supports only x64 EXEs currently.

# Features
- Configurable builder
- Payload encrypted and compressed (and optionally splitted) in the hollow loader
- Supports direct and indirect system calls
- Hollower does not use the very suspicious call Nt/ZwUnmapViewOfSection
- Can build EXE / DLL hollow loaders
- Can block unsigned microsoft DLLs from being loaded to the hollowed process
- Supports anti-debug techniques with the ability to die or to execute useless calculations ('troll' mode)
- Obfuscated sleep using useless calculations
- Support execution within VEH

# Injection methods
1. Simple hollowing: just the usual stuff: VirtualAlloc -> WriteProcessMemory -> GetThreadContext -> SetThreadContext -> ResumeThread.
2. Direct syscalls hollowing: using the great NimlineWhispers2.
3. Indirect syscalls hollowing: using the great NimlineWhispers3.
4. Splitted hollowing: each step of method (1) is occurring in a separate process with inherited handles.
5. Splitted hollowing: each step of method (2) is occurring in a separate process with inherited handles.
6. Splitted hollowing: each step of method (3) is occurring in a separate process with inherited handles.

Example of splitted hollowing of `cscript.exe` with `cmd.exe` that spawns `whoami.exe`:

# Installation
Built with Nim 1.6.12, should be run on Windows only.
```
nimble install winim ptr_math nimprotect supersnappy argparse
```

# Usage

```
Usage:
   [options] exe_file injection_method

Arguments:
  exe_file         Exe file to load
  injection_method Injection method

        1 - Simple hollowing
        2 - Direct syscalls hollowing
        3 - Indirect syscalls hollowing
        4 - Splitted hollowing using multiple processes
        5 - Splitted hollowing using multiple processes and direct syscalls
        6 - Splitted hollowing using multiple processes and indirect syscalls

Options:
  -h, --help
  -s, --sponsor=SPONSOR      Sponsor path to hollow (default: self hollowing)
  -a, --args=ARGS            Command line arguments to append to the hollowed process
  -f, --format=FORMAT        PE hollower format Possible values: [exe, dll] (default: exe)
  -e, --export=EXPORT        DLL export name (relevant only for Dll format) (default: DllRegisterServer)
  -b, --block                Block unsigned Microsoft Dlls in the hollowed process
  -p, --split                Split and hide the payload blob in hollower (takes long to compile!)
  -t, --sleep=SLEEP          Number of seconds to sleep before hollowing (default: 0)
  -g, --anti-debug=ANTI_DEBUG
                             Action to perform upon debugger detection Possible values: [none, die, troll] (default: none)
  -v, --veh                  Hollow will occur within VEH
  -d, --debug                Compile as debug instead of release (loader is verbose)
```
